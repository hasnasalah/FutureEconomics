<h1>Macroeconomic Forecasting Project: GDP Growth and Unemployment Rate Predictions</h1>

<p style="font-size:14px">
In this project I aim to forecast and the predict the United States Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and unemployment rate based on historical macroeconomic data.
From GDP, Unemployment rates, Governement expenditure and import & export.
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Predict GDP Growth: Using historical data and macroeconomic factors, forecast future GDP growth in the U.S.</li>
   <li>Forecast Unemployment Rate: Predict fluctuations in the unemployment rate based on variables like inflation, industrial production, and other economic indicators.</li>

<h2>Dataset Sources</h2>




<h2>Data Analysis and Visualization</h2>
In this project, we analyze key economic indicators, including GDP, unemployment rate, inflation, and government spending, to gain insights into economic trends. We visualize these indicators over time and apply statistical methods to better understand long-term trends and fluctuations.

<h3>Rolling Mean/Moving Average</h3>
A rolling mean (also known as a moving average) is applied to the GDP and unemployment time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations. This method helps eliminate noise and highlights underlying trends over time. By calculating the average of values over a specified window (e.g., 5 years), we can better visualize the long-term trajectory of these economic indicators.

This technique is crucial for:

Identifying consistent long-term trends in GDP and unemployment.
Improving the clarity of time-series data by reducing random noise.
Making it easier to forecast future values of economic indicators.
The rolling mean is overlaid on the original time series, providing a clearer view of both the raw data and its smoothed trends.
